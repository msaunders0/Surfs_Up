# Surfs_Up
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to provide information to a client on temperature trends in Oahu in order to facilitate the decision on whether to open a local surf and ice cream shop. The analysis will be used to determine if such a business would be sustainable year-round.

## Results
<ul>
  <li>The minimum temperature during the coldest month (December) is 56°, while the maximum is 83°. Minimum in June is 64° and maximum is 85°. These ranges are well within reason for a year-round surf and ice cream shop to operate.</li>
  <li>The average temperature is 75° in June and 71° in December.</li>
  <li>With 75% of temperatures recorded equal to or above 77° in June and 74° in December, we can fairly confidently say that it will rarely, if ever, be too hot or too cold for the business to thrive at any point in a given year.</li>
</ul>

## Summary
Judging by the results of this analysis, there is very little variation in the temperature in Oahu during the months of June and December. Given that the average temperature in June is 75° and 71° in December, plus the fact that the min/max in June is 64°/85° and 56°/83° in December, respectively, our client should feel confident in moving forward with their plans to open the surf and ice cream shop. Barring significant abnormalities in the weather (which would not subsist for any considerable amount of time), Oahu would be a perfect location for such a business to operate year-round.

Additionally, the precipitation data shows that the most it is ever likely to rain is 4.43 inches in June and 6.42 inches in December. Meanwhile, the average amount of precipitation is 0.13 inches for June and 0.2 inches for December. Based on these averages, rainfall in Oahu is not concerning and would not create a detrimental effect against the shop's ability to do business.

Finally, if we wanted to dissect the data further for more precise targetting, we could query the database to find out which stations recorded the highest and lowest amounts of precipitation, and determine where on the spectrum of precipitation would be ideal for our client's business. This could help us find the perfect location for the shop.
